Add desctiptions to form elements (below on mobile, to the right on desktop)
add default value to undefined protobufs, (omit if default to keep them small (only for ota packets))
add input validation min,max etc
maybe make channel editor acordion?
add url routing for settings tabs
add loading blur to card (prop)
form still considered dirty after save
form prefix should be located in the input (absolute?)
form suffix should focus input
reset store on new connection
redux actions seem to be dispatched twice
add qr generator in channel editor
no save button for channel config (bw,sf,cr,tx etc)
should reset store beased on disconnect state, as it can be set by the lirary, not just user interactions
way to set time for nodes, ntp?
